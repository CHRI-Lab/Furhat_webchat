Sprint 2 (checklist)
Each group to submit ONE (and only) checklist here on Canvas. Team-based submission (not individual-based).

 

## Confluence (infra)
Make sure that your Confluence satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] The students have produced an excellent structure of the project on Confluence. 
- [ ] Easy to find contents on pages.
- [ ] Most of the contents are visible and editable (no unnecessary attachments). 


## Confluence (contents and consistency) - Zhuowen
Make sure that your Confluence satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] Contents are available and updated on Confluence (meeting minutes, scope of the project, diagrams, technologies used in the project, user stories, test cases). 
- [ ] Contents are consistent with trello (or github project) and with their code repositories. 


## Task Tracking - Zhuowen
Make sure that your task tracking satisfy the following criteria:

- [ ] Students organized a product backlog and a lower-level sprint backlog. 
- [ ] Tasks in the sprint backlog were estimated, have an appropriate due date and have a sufficiently low level of granularity. 
- [ ] Tasks are also clear, linked to their user stories (Confluence) and offer additional description when necessary.
- [ ] A link to your Trello or JIRA (Anyone with link can access that resource) was made available to your marker.

 

## Code Review (Sprint 2) - Jiyuan Chen
Make sure that your code review satisfy the following criteria:

- [ ] Students documented their automated code review on Confluence (new page on Confluence to document how you performed your code review - who participated in that, when did that happen, number of issues identified and so on). Example of contents to include in this page: how many times did you perform code reviews? what was the selection criteria to decide what codes to be inspected? once code was reviewed, what happened next? how did you and your team review the received feedback from AI? provide examples on reviewed codes, received feedback and what actions happened after that (what changed in the code, what didn't change, and why). Comprehensive documentation here.
- [ ] In case you didn't use our OpenAI Key in this sprint (you created your own), please disconnect your GitHub repository from our ChatGPT Code Review one so you don't get charged in the future (or, make sure you continue to use this carefully and only when strictly necessary - do not use it for all commits)

 

## Sprint Planning and Review - Chengjia
Make sure that your sprint planning and review are documented on Confluence:
- [ ] Clear indication that sprint planning was followed this sprint and a clear, consistent, updated sprint planning for Sprint 3.
- [ ] Clear indication that sprint review was followed this sprint. Team organised a meeting for this, documented discussions, reflections and next steps to be taken in Sprint 3.

 

## Ethical Considerations - Shaohui
Make sure that your ethical considerations are documented on Confluence:
- [ ] Clear indication that students discussed/reflected on project ethical issues.

 

## Cyber Security - Shaohui
Make sure that your cyber security considerations are documented on Confluence:
- [ ] Clear indication that students discussed/reflected on project cyber security issues.

 

## Product
Make sure that your product satisfy the following criteria:

- [ ] Product is deployed and an URL is available on Confluence and Github README so client can access current version of this software.
- [ ] FOR PROJECTS YOU CANT DEPLOY IT NOW: Can you emulate the project and demonstrate current progress for us in a short recorded video? we need to be able to measure your development progress in Sprint 2, that's all.


## Meetings - Shaohui
Make sure your meetings (team meetings, supervision meetings and meetings with industry partners) are documented in Confluence (and only). 

- [ ] Meetings are recorded in Confluence and only. They were NOT exported to Github as they're part of internal process.


## GitHub
Make sure that: 

- [ ] Folders are structured.
- [ ] Sprint 2 documents were exported from Confluence and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository and new release
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint
