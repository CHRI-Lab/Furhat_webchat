We would like to support a number of cross-School/Department projects nominally up to $30k, although in exceptional cases up to $60k may be considered for support.The seed funding aims to encourage research collaboration across multiple disciplines, connecting researchers from CIS and EEE on projects that will lead to future externally funded project submissions.Goals of the programto nurture new collaborations, leading to long-term research connection between CIS & EEEto build new research capacity, particularly with a view to garnering external research supportto advance innovative research ideas, joining the expertise of CIS & EEEWe are calling for proposals that meet the above goals, show significant potential for future funding submissions, and have potential for broad impact.Assessment criteriaRequirements:Must include chief investigators from both CIS and EEE. The aim is to foster collaboration between School and Department.The project must be new.The project must identify and target a significant externally funded project submission (e.g., ARC linkage, industry contract etc)The follow-on bid for an externally funded project must be submitted within 12 months of project commencement.The following criteria will be used by a panel that including the Head of School CIS (or nominee) and Head of Department of EEE (or nominee) in ranking and selecting submissions:why seed funding is essential to the success of this projectthe plan for this project to lead into a submission of a larger funding bidthe novelty of the project and collaboration, in relation to the people, disciplines and School/Department involvedthe inclusion of ECRs
