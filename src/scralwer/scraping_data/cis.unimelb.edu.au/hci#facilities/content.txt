Our mission: To create the next generation of interactive technologies.We are a world-leading group of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers who study, teach and are fascinated by issues arising from humans interacting with emerging technologies. Our group has strong foundations in both qualitative and quantitative methods, and brings together cutting-edge technology design with development. Our state-of-the-art facilities enable us to create and study the next generation of interactive technologies, which we validate in a number of important application areas.View our publications




Research themes





Smart Spaces
Bringing together researchers who develop interactive technologies to augment our everyday environments.






Ubiquitous computing
Developing novel technologies that move beyond the desktop computing paradigm. The topics we work on include context awareness, sensing techniques, smartphone technologies, wearables, the Internet of Things, mobility analysis, and smart environments.






Digital health
Seeking to support citizens to take control of their health, to help health professionals get treatment to more people more efficiently, and to help health systems cope with increasing loads.






Digital nature
We investigate how digital technologies can be designed to help people enjoy, appreciate and learn about the natural world.






Novel interactions
Designing and developing prototypes using new interactive devices, including, but not limited to: virtual, augmented, and extended reality, eye tracking, physiological sensors, 3D printing, motion capture, projection mapping, interactive AI and machine learning.






Design for ageing
Investigating how new technologies can be designed and used to support people’s wellbeing and social connectedness in later life.






Games and play
Exploring the ways that people experience and create games and playful experiences; and seeking to understand how technology supports these activities.






Social computing and communities
Creating and evaluating sociotechnical systems that help mediate communication and collaboration between people.






Human information interaction
Our group is interested in the nexus of humans, technology and information. Having the right information at the right time is key to autonomy, decision making, and modern democracy.






Human-Robot Interaction
Our work brings together research from human-computer interaction, robotics, and AI to develop a robotics system that adapts to humans autonomously.

Facilities
Our researchers and students have access to a number of facilities at the University that allow them to develop and run experiments to push the boundaries of human-computer interaction. Each facility is unique and together provides researchers with end-to-end research capabilities from developing and manufacturing prototypes to running interaction design experiments.





User Experience Lab
A specialist facility for usability testing and interaction research, it supports a wide range of UI/UX activities and offers access to advanced audio-visual equipment and user testing tools such as observation rooms, HD cameras, microphone arrays and eye-trackers.






Interactive Technologies Lab
A research laboratory dedicated to the exploration, design and development of novel interactions equipped with technologies such as motion-capture, AR/VR headsets, depth sensor cameras, wearables, various sensors and electronics development kits.






Engineering Workshop
A workshop that has been running since 1938 that provides design consultancy and manufacturing services such as CNC machining, conventional machining, welding fabrication, 3D printing and scanning, sheet metal fabrication and plumbing.






Telstra Creator Space
An accessible fabrication lab located at Melbourne Connect precinct, where technology and creativity combine to design and build innovative solutions available to active Melbourne University students, academics, or Melbourne Connect tenants.
