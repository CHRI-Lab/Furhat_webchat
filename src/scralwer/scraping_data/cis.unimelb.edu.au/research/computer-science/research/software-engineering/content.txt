Software Engineering



About UsSoftware Engineering is a multidisciplinary field which focuses on the systematic design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications and systems. By bringing together principles from computer science with engineering best practices, the research area of software engineering investigates the methodologies, tools, and techniques needed to build software that is reliable, scalable, and efficient. From understanding user requirements to post-deployment maintenance, software engineering embodies the entire lifecycle of software development. Research areas within this theme encompass topics such as software quality assurance, agile methodologies, program repair, and human and social aspects of software engineering.
