Prof. Justin Zobel

Professor Justin ZobelProfessor in the School of Computing and Information Systems and Pro Vice-ChancellorThe University of MelbourneProfessor Justin Zobel is a Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor in the School of Computing and Information Systems and Pro Vice-Chancellor (Graduate and International Research), in which role he oversees the University’s graduate research training and international research partnerships. In the research community, Professor Zobel is best known for his role in the development of algorithms for efficient web search and for his contributions to robust research methodologies, and is the author of three highly regarded textbooks on graduate study and research practice.His research focuses on various topics, including aspects of the computational semantics of human language (such as text analysis, event detection and coreference, text summarisation and generation, question answering, discourse processing, ontologies, text mining, text annotation, and machine translation evaluation), aspects of social media (such as event detection and tracking, sentiment and opinion analysis, and author profile creation), analysis of the semantics of non-textual information such as tables, and aspects of digital government.
