Studying CIS in Your Undergraduate DegreeThe school of Computing and Information Systems offers majors to students in both the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Design. Students outside of these degrees, or who are interested in studying Computing and Information Systems outside of their selected major should consider taking our foundational CIS subjects for the elective or breadth component of their course.The introductory subjects Foundations of Computing and Foundations of Algorithms are designed to be highly accessible to students with no prior experience in programming or computer science, and provide a friendly and inclusive environment to learn programming fundamentals alongside other likeminded students.In the Bachelor of ScienceThree CIS majors are offered to students in the Bachelor of Science:









Computing and Software Systems Major
The Computing and Information Systems major is the largest undergraduate major in the school of CIS. This flexible major allows Science and Design students to pursue their own interests in IT, and acts as a natural pathway to many master's courses.






Data Science Major
The Data Science major covers essential topics in statistics and computer science and equips students with the tools needed to process big data and deploy state-of-the-art predictive and machine learning models.






Spatial Systems Major
The Spatial Systems major prepares students to collect, process, analyse, and generate insights from spatial data. It is available through the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Design.





Students in the Bachelor of Science will also have the option to take CIS subjects as electives regardless of their chosen major.In the Bachelor of DesignCIS also offers three majors to students in the Bachelor of Design. Two of these are also offered in the Bachelor of science:Computing and Software Systems, which provides a high level of flexibility to pursue interests in any CIS domain, and acts as a natural pathway to master's courses like the Masters of Software Engineering, Information Technology, and Computer Science.Spatial Systems, which teaches students the spatial measurement and analysis skills to become leaders in this fast growing engineering and IT field.Bachelor of Design students also have access to an additional major which is not available to students in the Bachelor of Science:User Experience Design, which provides the practical skills and knowledge to create designs for digital platforms and technologies.Students in the Bachelor of Design are able to take many CIS subjects as electives, and may have the option to take them as breadth subjects depending on their selected major.







Concurrently With Any Undergraduate DegreeFor undergraduate students looking to develop IT and Data Science experience without selecting one of the above majors, the Diploma in Computing is available to students enrolled in any undergraduate degree. The diploma adds 100 credit points of subjects, and is designed to be taken concurrently with an undergraduate degree to complement your existing studies.Undergraduate students outside of the Bachelor of Science may also take CIS subjects for the breadth component of their course.
