Programming proficiency test


Students wishing to undertake Foundations of Algorithms (COMP10002) and/or Database Systems (INFO20003) without having completed the prerequisite subjects must achieve at least 75% in the programming proficiency test.The programming proficiency test is held at the start of each semester. If there is sufficient demand the test will be held during Orientation week and a second test sitting will be held during the first week of semester. If you register for the test, you will be contacted with information and details of the test the week before the test runs (ie, the week before Orientation week) and not before.You cannot take the test if:You have previously taken the programming proficiency test.You have enrolled in COMP10001 Foundations of Computing in a previous semester.We recommend that students:Register for the programming proficiency test.Enrol in COMP10001*.Sit the programming proficiency test.Go along to lectures for both COMP10001 and COMP10002 and/or INFO20003 until you receive the results of the test.If you pass the test then you can enrol in COMP10002 and/or INFO20003 and drop COMP10001.The test will consist of a number of programming tasks of varying complexity. It will be run in pen-and-paper mode (you will not have access to a computer), and will be 60 minutes in duration.You may answer using any programming language and you must provide the language name on the answer paper. In terms of content, it is loosely based on the level a COMP10001 student would reach, but poses general programming questions.In order to pass the test and gain direct entry into either subject, you will need to attain a score of at least 75%. You will be informed by email of your score within a few business days after sitting the test. If you pass, we will provide you with details on the process to complete your enrolment in COMP10002 and/or INFO20003.Register for the test* Note: You cannot concurrently enrol in COMP100001 and COMP100002 for the same semester: if you need COMP10001 in order to take COMP10002 then you need to pass it before before enrolling in COMP10002.
