Our mission: To create the next generation of interactive technologies.We are a world-leading group of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers who study, teach and are fascinated by issues arising from humans interacting with emerging technologies. Our group has strong foundations in both qualitative and quantitative methods, and brings together cutting-edge technology design with development. Our state-of-the-art facilities enable us to create and study the next generation of interactive technologies, which we validate in a number of important application areas.View our publications




Research themes





Smart Spaces
Bringing together researchers who develop interactive technologies to augment our everyday environments.






Ubiquitous computing
Developing novel technologies that move beyond the desktop computing paradigm. The topics we work on include context awareness, sensing techniques, smartphone technologies, wearables, the Internet of Things, mobility analysis, and smart environments.






Digital health
Seeking to support citizens to take control of their health, to help health professionals get treatment to more people more efficiently, and to help health systems cope with increasing loads.






Digital nature
We investigate how digital technologies can be designed to help people enjoy, appreciate and learn about the natural world.






Novel interactions
Designing and developing prototypes using new interactive devices, including, but not limited to: virtual, augmented, and extended reality, eye tracking, physiological sensors, 3D printing, motion capture, projection mapping, interactive AI and machine learning.






Design for ageing
Investigating how new technologies can be designed and used to support people’s wellbeing and social connectedness in later life.






Games and play
Exploring the ways that people experience and create games and playful experiences; and seeking to understand how technology supports these activities.






Social computing and communities
Creating and evaluating sociotechnical systems that help mediate communication and collaboration between people.






Human information interaction
Our group is interested in the nexus of humans, technology and information. Having the right information at the right time is key to autonomy, decision making, and modern democracy.






Human-Robot Interaction
Our work brings together research from human-computer interaction, robotics, and AI to develop a robotics system that adapts to humans autonomously.
