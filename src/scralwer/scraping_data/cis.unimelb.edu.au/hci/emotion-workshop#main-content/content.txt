The Future of Emotion in HCI





The Future of Emotion in Human-Computer Interaction

A workshop at CHI 2022 on 13/14th April.OverviewEmotion has been studied in HCI for two decades, with specific traditions interested in sensing, expressing, transmitting, modelling, experiencing, visualizing, understanding, constructing, regulating, manipulating or adapting to emotion in human-human and human-computer interactions. This CHI 2022 workshop on the Future of Emotion in Human-Computer Interaction brings together interested researchers to encourage connection and collaboration, identify common interests, discuss and develop methodologies, and map the changing relationship between emotion and technology. Through group discussion and collaborative speculation we will address questions such as:What are the relationships between digital technology and human emotion?What roles does emotion play in HCI research?How should HCI researchers conceptualize emotion?When should HCI researchers use interdisciplinary theories of emotion or create new theory?Can specific emotions be designed for, and where is this knowledge likely to be applied?What are the implications of emotion research for design, ethics and wellbeing?What is the future of emotion in human-computer interaction?Our goals are to:map past and future trajectories of emotion research in HCIarticulate phenomena of interest, experiences, understandings and research questionsdiscuss the utility of different methodologies and interdisciplinary theorieshighlight important issues for research, design, policy and wellbeingdiscuss emerging technologies and their likely implicationsbuild a community of researchers who can develop a framework and agenda for ongoing researchWe aim to publish a workshop summary in Interactions, and develop a journal special issue.For more detail please see our  proposal document .OrganizersOur team of organizers represents a range of disciplines and geographic regions.Anna Cox is a Professor in the UCL Interaction Centre at University College London. Her research focuses on the relationships between the design of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and behavioural outcomes, and leverages these relationships in the design of novel interfaces and systems to support people in managing their work and well-being.James Gross is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. His research focuses on emotion and emotion regulation, and he has developed the widely used Process Model of Emotion Regulation.Kristina Höök is Professor of Interaction Design at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, with research interests in affective interaction and somaesthetic design. Her recent book “Designing with the Body: Somaesthetic Interaction Design" was published by MIT Press.Vassilis Kostakos is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Melbourne in Australia and Head of the Human-Computer Interaction Group. His research interests focus on ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, social computing, and Internet of Things.Peter Koval is a Senior Lecturer in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences at the University of Melbourne. His research focuses on the dynamics of subjective emotional experience and the deliberate regulation of emotion in daily life.Regan Mandryk is a Canada Research Chair in Digital Gaming Technologies and Experiences and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan. Her work focuses on how people use playful technologies for emotion regulation, social connection, and to manage their mental health and wellbeing.Petr Slovák is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow and a lecturer at King’s College London, based at the Informatics and Child Adolescent Psychiatry department. His research focuses on envisioning, designing, and evaluating new technology-enabled mental health interventions for children and families, with specific focus on emotion regulation.Wally Smith is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. His research focus is human-centred computing, with current projects on emotion regulation, deceptive tendencies of AI, and digital engagement in cultural institutions.Greg Wadley is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Australia, working on the design of technologies for health and wellbeing including projects in mental health, emotion regulation, and chronic disease management.Sarah Webber is a Research Fellow at the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. Her research focuses on design of technologies for connection with nature, and digital interactions for social connectedness and wellbeing.Format and TimingTo maximise accessibility the workshop will be fully online, with participants connecting through Zoom, Miro, Slack and this website. For inclusivity across time zones the workshop is running as two events or instances, both with similar structures lasting 2.5 hours, starting at these times:Wed 13th April, 0800 UTC (click for local times)Wed 13th April, 2300 UTC (click for local times)Individual participants may attend either or both instances as preferred, but each paper will be presented at only one of the instances.ProgramSession 1: Building Community (one hour)We have accepted 40 papers, which are listed below. Each paper is presented (at one of the two events) for 3 minutes, which includes the presentation plus brief discussion.Session 2: Taking Stock and Imagining Futures (one hour)There will be a panel discussion during each instance, with panel members listed below. Our goal is to identify different approaches to emotion that have been taken in HCI, and identify emerging trends and speculate on their potential implications for research, technology design and human wellbeing.Session 3: Making Plans (half an hour)Discuss future plans, publications and collaborations.SchedulesThe structure of each workshop instance:
