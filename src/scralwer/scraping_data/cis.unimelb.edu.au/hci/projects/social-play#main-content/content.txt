Social play in immersive gaming environments







Social play in immersive gaming environments






Project overviewGaming often drives the early adoption of Natural User Interfaces (NUIs), and serves as a testing ground for their development. Technologies created for gaming, such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect and the Tobii Eye Tracker 4C, enable new types of playful and immersive experiences — and often go on to impact wider society. However, while there is substantial research into the user experience of NUIs in work-like computer tasks, very little research has examined NUIs in the context of games and immersive environments. We believe that studying NUI in the game context is relevant to the use of these technologies, because the game experience can be quite different when immersed or embodied.Research under this project generates knowledge about designing with NUIs in social games, through case studies that interrogate social play in games. The research agenda is multi-modal, and aims to contribute a rich understanding regarding the relationship between game embodiment, immersion and interface design.In addition to academic articles, we communicate results in game industry and non-specialist publications, host talks at game conventions, demonstrate and exemplify our findings through videos, and develop game prototypes that demonstrate the foundations of our design guidelines.Social voiceVoice is widely used in social and competitive gameplay as a communication modality between players, where it has been shown to vastly improve player experience. However, as an input device for play, voice has a mixed status. It is often marginal and maligned due to the limitations of the technology, but sometimes fêted as a socially engaging way to play. In this project, we seek to understand the parameters of designing for voice interaction with game-like characters, through a study of existing practices and through the evaluation of for-purpose experimental games.This project is led by Fraser Allison.Social gazeEyePlay research seeks to understand how gaze detection technologies can provide new and novel player and spectator experiences. This project examines the effects of gaze and how it can create social experiences in multiplayer games, through the exploration of its detection and display.This project is led by Joshua Newn.Social tabletopTabletop gaming is a highly social situation due to the configuration of players and the social interactions afforded by tabletop game pieces. This project examines non-digital tabletop games and their digitisations to identify opportunities for NUI technologies to afford social play.This project is led by Melissa Rogerson.Social MinecraftThe sandbox-world builder game Minecraft is exceedingly popular, near ubiquitous in children between 8–12 and was recently purchased for $2billion dollars by Microsoft. This popularity, and its emphasis on creative world building, social interactions and cooperation have seen it adopted in schools and released as a standalone Minecraft for Education project. This project examines the social play of Minecraft and how it can support opportunities for social learning.This project is led by PhD student Jane Mavoa, under the supervision of Martin Gibbs, Marcus Carter and Bjorn Nansen.FundingThese projects were funded by the University of Melbourne’s Microsoft Research Centre for Social Natural User Interfaces (SocialNUI).Project teamMartin Gibbs,  ProfessorEduardo Velloso, Senior LecturerFrank Vetere, ProfessorWally Smith, Associate ProfessorFraser Allison, Research FellowJoshua Newn, Research FellowMelissa Rogerson, LecturerJane Mavoa, PhD CandidateMarcus Carter, Senior Lecturer in Digital Cultures, University of SydneyContact detailsMartin GibbsEmail: martin.gibbs@unimelb.edu.auPublicationsAllison, F., Carter, M., Gibbs, M. & Smith, W.
