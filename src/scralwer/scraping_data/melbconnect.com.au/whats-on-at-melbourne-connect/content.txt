What's On at Melbourne Connect
Melbourne Connect's events program offers innovation and inspiration across a range of topics and industries. From academic lectures and debates to graduate exhibitions, innovation festivals that engage the whole city, and cocktail networking events with our entrepreneurial community. Many of our events are open to the public and free to attend, so we look forward to welcoming you to one of our upcoming events.
























Melbourne Design Week: Melbourne Connect X MSD Program
Melbourne Connect and Melbourne School of Design (MSD) are proudly participating in Melbourne Design Week, Australia’s largest and leading annual design festival, taking place from 23 May to 2 June 2024. Exploring this year’s theme of “Design the World You Want,” the program brings into focus the utilisation of energy, ethics and ecology to encourage positive change, reimagine existing systems and offer innovative design solutions to complex global challenges.
Melbourne Design Week showcases design through an extensive 11-day program featuring talks, tours, exhibitions, launches, installations and workshops across Australia’s design capital.
