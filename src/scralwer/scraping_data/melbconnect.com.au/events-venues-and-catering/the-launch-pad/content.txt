The Launch Pad
The Launch Pad showcases a central open plan area to facilitate ideation and knowledge sharing between precinct tenants, the University, guests and the business sector. 
A dynamic space used for creating, prototyping, pitching and testing, it is the hotspot of the Superfloor with an ever-changing canvas of events and activations. 
With a 70-person capacity, this high-traffic area of the Superfloor provides an open plan hub of knowledge exchange for those within the precinct.
























How to Get There
The Launch Pad is accessible via the Superfloor of Melbourne Connect.
Enter the foyer through the revolving glass doors from the covered walkway at 700 Swanston Street and proceed to the Superfloor via the stairs or by using the lifts on the right side of the foyer (press M on the lift call button). Upon exiting the lifts, proceed through the glass doors at the end of the lift gallery and turn left to see the Launch Pad. 
If arriving on the Superfloor via the stairs, proceed to the concierge desk and turn left to walk around the Superfloor Cafe and then left again to proceed to the Launch Pad.
