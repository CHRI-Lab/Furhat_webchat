The Studio
The Studio is a high-traffic space with ground floor exposure at Melbourne Connect, this 70-person tiered seating space is a lively area that hosts workshops, hackathons, group activities, and has a “war room” for project work. 
Visible to passers-by on the ground floor of the precinct, it offers a sneak peek into Melbourne Connect’s energetic and dynamic community.
























How to Get There
The Studio is accessible via the ground floor of Melbourne Connect.
Proceed up the covered walkway at 700 Swanston Street towards the centre of Melbourne Connect (The Oculus). Once at the top of the brick walkway, turn left and walk towards the large glass sliding doors on the ground floor and look for The Studio signage. 
Please go to the concierge inside on Level M if any further directions are required.
