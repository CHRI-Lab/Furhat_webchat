The Superfloor
The 3,600sqm Superfloor sets a new global benchmark for innovation community curation and partner amenity. A dedicated collaboration space that connects the Precinct, the Superfloor is accessible to all colocated partners and has been designed by leading architect Woods Bagot, creating a space that will be at the heart of the innovation community and foster a culture of collaboration and be supported by a dedicated team of curators and connectors.
The Superfloor is open and operational between 8am and 8pm Monday-Friday and offers a range of spaces available for hire including The Forum, The Studio, and The Launchpad.
With year-round activations and events held in this space including pitches, demo days, hackathons, launches, exhibitions, skills development, social and cultural events, it is a place that brings the community together.
























How to Get There
The Superfloor is accessible through the main foyer doors of Melbourne Connect. Enter the foyer through the revolving glass doors from the walkway at 700 Swanston Street and proceed to the Superfloor via the stairs or by using the lifts on the right side of the foyer (press M on the lift call button).
Upon exiting the lifts or arriving at the top of the stairs, proceed to the concierge desk for any further assistance.
