Womin-djerring
An open air oculus known as womin-djerring (come together) sits in the centre of Melbourne Connect. 
Surrounded by laneways named tongerambi kalk way (birthing tree), ngang-gak djerring walk (listening together), yagila-djerring walk (learning / searching together), and toom-djerring walk (speaking together), this space connects the public to the precinct.
























How to Get There
Womin-djerring is accessible via the ground floor of Melbourne Connect.
Proceed up the covered walkway at 700 Swanston Street towards the centre of Melbourne Connect (The Oculus) and onto the timber deck. 
Please go to the concierge inside on Level M if any further directions are required.
