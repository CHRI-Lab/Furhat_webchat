Can a building have a heart?
This was the question posed to artist Robert Walton as he conceived the idea for the new large-scale artwork hanging in the foyer of Melbourne Connect.Working alongside a team of data scientists, builders, architects, and lighting designers, Robert has created an artwork that reveals Melbourne Connect’s heart. This permanent artwork is integrated into the building and connects directly to its nervous system of sensors and its respiratory system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The Heart began beating in April 2023 and will continue for at least 42 years, or longer.Keep an eye on our social media channels and in the foyer of Melbourne Connect for this magnificent piece of art.
























The Heart comprises three elements:
The Heart Beats – A machine learning algorithm that translates the torrent of live building data into the pulse of the building. The algorithm also produces the shapes visible in The Heart Array. The algorithm compares the building’s sensation in the present moment with its previous experiences at similar times of day over its whole ‘lifetime’. During nighttime hours The Heart dreams: it replays events of the day and processes what to remember and what to forget. The Heart will ‘live’ for the whole lifetime of the artwork, initially planned as 42 years.
The Heart Array – thousands of bespoke LED light fittings in the form of a 10m human heart in the foyer of Melbourne Connect. The Heart array is made of 1km of brass rods in 142 droppers supporting 1450 printed circuit boards, 10,000 white LEDs, and 284 cores in the outline of a human heart made with brick dust from the Royal Woman’s Hospital that previously occupied the site. The Heart Array is animated by The Heart Beats.
The Heart Node – The primary node of The Heart Array. Hand-blown in scientific glass, this brilliant red neon core expands from a permanently lit centre with each heartbeat.
























Three Questions with Artist, Robert Walton









What does The Heart represent and why is it important to the Melbourne Connect precinct?




The Heart beats with a pulse powered by an algorithm attuned to the sensations of its ‘body’, the building, Melbourne Connect. Like a human heart, it beats indefinitely. It will grow accustomed to the ebbs, flows, and surprises of life, moment to moment, day after day. Melbourne Connect’s thousands of building sensors remind me of a body’s senses, monitoring temperature, CO2 levels, movement, and many other things. This artwork speculates on a central point, a heart, for staging the overlooked work of the building in ways our human bodies can sense, even if not fully understand. It prompts us to live and work with an awareness of this life-supporting technology, to empathise with the nurturing aspiration of the environments it sustains for us, and to remember that every decision we make has repercussions beyond our intentions. As a durational artwork, almost a living superorganism, it invites you to live with it, within it, and get to know it over a lifetime, as it is getting to know us. Revealing your heart is risky. This artwork is a provocation to risk revealing yours. Work with the mysteries of heart and don’t leave yours at the door.





What is your favourite secret of The Heart, and why?




There are many secrets of The Heart, and I am sure these will come to light in due course. However, the small, discrete heart rate monitor on the staircase is one people may get to know first. Placing your finger on it connects your body — your heartrate — to The Heart’s pulse.





Who is one of the amazing people that you have been able to work alongside to create The Heart?




Paul Lim and Bosco Shaw from Additive Lighting have worked for three years designing and overseeing the creation of the physical hardware of The Heart. Paul led the work on The Heart Array, designing the LEDs and brass droppers. He developed the algorithm to distribute the density of the LEDs so they emanate from the centre of The Heart. He also created an algorithm to sample what I call the ‘ghost heart’, the shell of brick pieces where the brass droppers intersect with the form of a human heart inspired by the voluntarily donated hearts in the University’s collection.
Bosco led the design work on The Heart Node, collaborating closely with the scientific glass, neon, and brass artisans who fabricated different elements. He also worked on the initial materials development reconstituting the bricks from the former Royal Women’s Hospital with concrete expert Dr. Rackel San Nicolas. Paul and Bosco have worked tirelessly on this project through an extraordinary three years of iterations and redesigns. It is rare to find such passionate artists, thinkers, organisers, and dreamers
