# Project Overview

This project aims to create an innovative Q&A platform using a Furhat robot, driven by the need for a specialized and interactive information resource. The platform leverages web scraping and advanced language processing to build a robot that acts as a dynamic and intelligent receptionist.

## Background

The initiative is driven by the need for a specialized and interactive information resource that leverages vast data from websites like Melbourne Connect or CIS. The core idea is to harness web scraping and advanced language processing to create a robot that serves as both an information source and a dynamic receptionist.

## Phases

- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Web scraping to build a knowledge foundation.
- **Language Model Development:** Creating a domain-specific LLM for accurate responses.
- **Robot Integration:** Implementing the LLM in the Furhat robot for interactive conversations.
- **Receptionist Functionalities:** Enhancing the platform with various receptionist duties.

## Team Roles

- Product Manager: Zhuowen Zheng
- Scrum Master: Xi Luo
- Architecture Lead: Shaohui Wang
- Quality Assurance Lead: Chengjia Zhou
- Development Environment Lead: Jiyuan Chen
- Deployment Lead: Peng Tang

## Client Goals

Develop a domain-specific Q&A system integrating advanced language models with robotic technology to provide accurate and engaging user assistance.

## Motivation
